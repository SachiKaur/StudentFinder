# StudentFinder

As my final assignment I made this small project with a fellow classmate. The assignment was to make an assignment for a customer. The customer I chose was a teacher that wanted me and my classmate to make a program that would allow him to enter student numbers and in return giving him an excel file full of student information such as their name, a picture of the student, the classes they have during a certain day/period.

For the program to run follow these steps:
1) On the top left corner click on the setting's button
2) Under "Enter the Picture Directory" enter the path to which the program can access the student pictures. Note the student pictures must be named after the student numbers. Also the student pictures must be "jpg". Also if the picture are in the same directory as the jar file keep it empty.
3) For "Enter a name for an excel file" or "Enter a name for a sheet in an excel file" this can be changed to your liking
4) For "Enter the txt file name which contain the student information" this must be a text file which contains all the information of the students and it must be in the same format as the one in the folder called "TimeTables-Oct2015.txt"
5) For "Enter the title that should be shown on the excel file" this can be changed to you liking but you must enter something.
6) Press Enter
7) Enter the student numbers which you would the information for
8) Enter the semester and the period (the last option shows all periods)
9) Enter the day which you would want the information for
10) Press Enter
11) Using the arrow buttons you can go see all the student pictures and information
12) If you like this info to become an excel file click "Save As Excel File" and wait until the message "the excel file has been upgraded" and then you can open the excel file
